# AI-Powered-Email-Reader-with-Qwen-2-VL-&-TTS
In this tutorial, we built an AI-powered email reader using Qwen2.5-VL to extract and summarize email content from screenshots. The system processes text and images, extracts key details, and generates concise summaries. With TTS for audio output and a Gradio-based UI, users can upload screenshots and receive both text and speech summaries.
